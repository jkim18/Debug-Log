i. I wanted the rectangles to stay the same color as they fell.

ii. Instead, they turned black after the key was released.

iii. Might have to add the color function into list.add.

iv. Under list.add, I wrote in "color(pitch*3, 255, 255)"

iii. Said the constructor rect(int, int, int) did not exist.

iv. Added color c into constructor "Rect(int x, int y, color c)"
then added "this.c = c;"
