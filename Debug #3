i. I expected the lowest note to start getting drawn at the end of the screen at the left. 

ii. Instead it started about a fourth from the edge.

iii. I think it might have been because the pitch of the lowest note was written as "28", instead of "0". Might have to do 
something to the code where it subtracts 28 from 104, which is the highest pitch. Possibly add another integer to set the 
minPitch.

iv. Created "final int minPitch = 28;" but also have to subtract it from maxPitch 104 in the rect() function. 
"rect((pitch - minPitch)*width/(maxPitch - minPitch), 100, width/maxPitch, 50);"
