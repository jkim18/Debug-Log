i. I wanted the rectangles to fade as they fell.

ii. They stayed the same, but wouldn't fade no matter what I tried. It would either change a different color, go 
transparent, or not change at all. 

iii. I add float transparency; float dtrans; in the code, then float a = map(transparency, 0, 1, 0, 255); and 
fill(pitch*3, 255, 255, a); 

iv. This just caused the rectangles to stay the same as they fell.

iii. Also tried adding fill(0xee, 0xee, 0xff, 50); 

iv. This just made the rectangles turn a shade of pink.

iii. I tried to create new rectangles with list.add and make the fill 0

iv. But this only made it turn completely white


iii. I am going to keep working with the code until I figure out how to make it fade.
