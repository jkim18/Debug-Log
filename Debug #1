i. Rectangles are drawn when notes are pressed, and fall when they are released. It was doing what I expected.

ii. However, an error that says "ConcurrentModificationException" kept popping up after the animation would freeze.

iii. I thought it was possibly because there was no integer for Rect r

iv. There was no change after adding int Rect r to the code.

v. I eventually asked JD who told me that when one part of the code is running, it interrupts another. Since the code to draw
new rectangles and the code to move them are in different threads, each one cancels the other out. In order for the code to 
keep running, "synchronized(this) {" had to be added under void draw(), void noteOn(), and void noteOff().
